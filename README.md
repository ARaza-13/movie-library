This project is a basic movie library manager where you can create lists of movies you have watched

Making this project required concepts from javascript such as objects, object constructors, dom manipulation and events, as well as HTML form and CSS grid and positioning concepts

*Updated code with implementation of classes instead of plain constructors*
